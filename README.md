A REST backend for a cinema chain. Admins run the catalogue of cinemas, auditoriums, movies and showtimes; customers hold seats and pay for them. It is the phase 1 project of the Software Architecture course at VNU University of Engineering and Technology (UET).

## Features

**Catalogue management (Admin)**
- Cinemas and auditoriums. An auditorium's seat layout is generated from its size (up to 26 rows), and each row is Standard, VIP or Couple.
- Movies and showtimes. A showtime ends after the movie's length plus 15 minutes of cleaning, and two showtimes in the same auditorium can't overlap.
- Showtime cancellation with a reason (equipment failure, power outage, emergency, other). One transaction refunds the paid bookings and releases the unpaid ones.

**Booking (Customer)**
- Self-registration and JWT login.
- Showtimes filtered by date, cinema and movie, and a live seat map with availability and prices.
- 1 to 8 seats per booking, held for 10 minutes until payment (simulated).
- A database unique constraint stops a seat from being sold twice, including when many customers race for it.

**Platform**
- OpenAPI 3.1 documentation with Swagger UI.
- Every error in [RFC 9457](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9457) Problem Details format.
- Versioned schema migrations with Flyway.
- Health and metrics endpoints through Spring Boot Actuator.
- A Docker image, published to GitHub Container Registry.

## Domain model

```mermaid
erDiagram
    CINEMA ||--o{ AUDITORIUM : has
    AUDITORIUM ||--|{ SEAT : "laid out as"
    AUDITORIUM ||--o{ SHOWTIME : hosts
    MOVIE ||--o{ SHOWTIME : "screened as"
    ACCOUNT ||--o{ BOOKING : places
    SHOWTIME ||--o{ BOOKING : "booked for"
    BOOKING ||--|{ BOOKED_SEAT : "holds 1 to 8"
    SEAT ||--o{ BOOKED_SEAT : "taken by"

    SEAT {
        string row_letter
        int seat_number
        string type
    }
    SHOWTIME {
        timestamptz starts_at
        timestamptz ends_at
        bigint base_price
        string status
    }
    BOOKING {
        string status
        timestamptz expires_at
    }
    BOOKED_SEAT {
        bigint price
    }
```

The database enforces three rules on its own:

- `booked_seat` has `UNIQUE(showtime_id, seat_id)`, so a seat is booked at most once per showtime.
- A partial unique index allows one `PENDING` booking per customer.
- An exclusion constraint rejects overlapping showtimes in the same auditorium, ignoring cancelled ones.

[`GLOSSARY.md`](GLOSSARY.md) defines each term (Hold, Pending, Refunded and the rest).

## Booking lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Pending: POST /bookings (seats held 10 min)
    Pending --> Confirmed: payment within hold
    Pending --> Expired: hold lapses
    Pending --> [*]: customer abandons (DELETE) or admin cancels the showtime
    Expired --> [*]: deleted when its seats are booked or its customer books again
    Confirmed --> Refunded: admin cancels the showtime
```

Each booked seat keeps the price it had when the booking was made, so later price changes don't affect it:

| Seat type | Price |
|---|---|
| Standard | base price |
| VIP | base price + 20,000 VND |
| Couple | 2 × base price + 10,000 VND |

A customer can have only one live pending booking at a time, a showtime can't be booked once it has started, and paying a confirmed booking again returns it unchanged. The [booking walkthrough](docs/booking-walkthrough.md) runs the whole lifecycle on a live service.

## Architecture

The service is one deployable with a layered architecture, one package per layer under `vn.edu.uet.cinema`.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    client([HTTP client]) --> api
    subgraph app [Cinema service]
        api["<b>api</b><br/>controllers, DTOs,<br/>error mapping"]
        business["<b>business</b><br/>domain models, services,<br/>repository interfaces"]
        persistence["<b>persistence</b><br/>JPA entities, Spring Data,<br/>repository adapters"]
        config["<b>config</b><br/>security, wiring, OpenAPI"]
        api --> business
        persistence -- implements --> business
        config -.-> api & business & persistence
    end
    persistence --> db[(PostgreSQL)]
```

| Layer | Responsibility | Allowed dependencies |
|---|---|---|
| `api` | Maps HTTP to use cases, validates input, renders errors | `business`, Spring Web |
| `business` | Domain rules and use cases | JDK only |
| `persistence` | Implements the business repository interfaces with JPA | `business`, JPA |
| `config` | Security rules, bean wiring, OpenAPI | everything |

Design decisions:

- The business layer imports no Spring, JPA or web code. It owns the repository interfaces and the persistence layer implements them, so business rules can be read and unit tested on their own ([ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-framework-free-business-layer.md)).
- `ArchitectureTest` (ArchUnit) fails the build when a layer imports a package it is not allowed to.
- Spring Security's filter chain validates the JWT before any controller runs. Every access rule is in `config/SecurityConfig.java`, and controllers have no auth code.
- The database settles seat contention. Concurrent bookings race on the `booked_seat` insert, the loser gets a `409`, and there are no application locks. A lapsed hold is deleted the next time someone books one of its seats ([ADR 0004](docs/adr/0004-seat-contention-via-unique-constraint-and-lazy-holds.md)).

When two Customers want the same Seat, the unique index decides who gets it:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor A as Customer A
    actor B as Customer B
    participant S as Cinema service
    participant DB as PostgreSQL
    A->>S: POST /bookings (Seat A2)
    B->>S: POST /bookings (Seat A2)
    S->>DB: tx A: Showtime FOR SHARE, delete lapsed Holds on A2
    S->>DB: tx B: Showtime FOR SHARE, delete lapsed Holds on A2
    Note over DB: share locks don't block each other
    S->>DB: tx A: insert Booking + booked_seat(A2)
    S->>DB: tx B: insert Booking + booked_seat(A2)
    Note over DB: tx B waits on UNIQUE(showtime_id, seat_id)
    DB-->>S: tx A commits
    S-->>A: 201 Pending, Hold for 10 min
    DB-->>S: tx B: unique violation, rolled back
    S->>DB: read occupied Seats
    S-->>B: 409 Problem Details, taken: [A2]
    Note over S,DB: a deadlock between lapsed-Hold deletes<br/>is retried once, then gets a 409 asking to retry
```

## Getting started

You need Docker with Docker Compose.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/14m6d4/se-phase-01.git
cd se-phase-01
cp .env.example .env          # set your own secrets in .env
docker compose up --build
```

The service is ready when the log shows `Started CinemaApplication`.

| URL | Purpose |
|---|---|
| http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html | Interactive API docs |
| http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs | OpenAPI specification (JSON; `/v3/api-docs.yaml` for YAML) |
| http://localhost:8080/actuator/health | Health check |

The Admin account comes from `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` at startup. Compose refuses to start if a required variable is missing, and both containers listen on `127.0.0.1` only.

The [development guide](docs/development.md) covers running without Compose, every environment variable, a `curl` login example and the project layout.

## API overview

Base path: `/api`. Swagger UI and [`docs/openapi.json`](docs/openapi.json) have the full request and response schemas.

| Resource | Endpoint | Access |
|---|---|---|
| **Auth** | `POST /auth/register` | Public |
| | `POST /auth/login` | Public |
| | `GET /me` | Authenticated |
| **Cinemas** | `GET /cinemas`, `GET /cinemas/{id}` | Public |
| | `POST /cinemas`, `PUT /cinemas/{id}`, `DELETE /cinemas/{id}` | Admin |
| **Auditoriums** | `GET /cinemas/{id}/auditoriums`, `GET /auditoriums/{id}` | Public |
| | `POST /cinemas/{id}/auditoriums`, `DELETE /auditoriums/{id}` | Admin |
| **Movies** | `GET /movies`, `GET /movies/{id}` | Public |
| | `POST /movies`, `PUT /movies/{id}`, `DELETE /movies/{id}` | Admin |
| **Showtimes** | `GET /showtimes?date=&cinemaId=&movieId=` | Public |
| | `GET /showtimes/{id}`, `GET /showtimes/{id}/seats` | Public |
| | `POST /showtimes`, `DELETE /showtimes/{id}` | Admin |
| | `POST /showtimes/{id}/cancellation` | Admin |
| **Bookings** | `GET /bookings`, `GET /bookings/{id}` | Customer |
| | `POST /bookings`, `DELETE /bookings/{id}` | Customer |
| | `POST /bookings/{id}/payment` | Customer |

A login returns a bearer token valid for one hour; send it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Every error is `application/problem+json`:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `400` | Invalid request body or parameters |
| `401` | Missing, invalid or expired token |
| `403` | Authenticated but lacking the required role |
| `404` | Resource not found (including another customer's booking) |
| `409` | Business rule violation, e.g. seat already taken, overlapping showtime, hold expired |

Money is an integer amount in VND. Timestamps are ISO-8601 with an offset. The service runs on `Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh`, and `?date=` covers that calendar day in Vietnam time.

## Testing

```bash
./mvnw verify
```

Docker must be running, because the integration tests start a real PostgreSQL through Testcontainers. The suite has four kinds of test:

- Unit tests for the business layer, which need no Spring context.
- Integration tests for controllers and repositories against PostgreSQL.
- Architecture tests (ArchUnit) for the layer rules.
- Contract tests checking that the generated OpenAPI specification lists every operation, error response and security requirement.

## Performance

The current capacity baseline uses [k6](https://k6.io/) v2.3.0 on two independent public Kaggle CPU notebooks. The service, PostgreSQL and k6 share each notebook, with k6 pinned to one CPU and the service plus PostgreSQL on CPUs 1-3. [`docs/loadtest-baseline.md`](docs/loadtest-baseline.md) records the source snapshot, stepped results, telemetry and comparison. Rates are in it/s, completed workflows per second; browse and book make two HTTP requests per workflow.

![Capacity baseline summary](docs/loadtest/summary.png)

| Scenario | Highest held, it/s (Run 1 / Run 2) | Gave out first |
|---|---:|---|
| account | 1,200 / 1,200 | Application request queue (Tomcat threads, Hikari pending) |
| browse | 400 / 400 | Inconclusive: k6 at 92-93% of its one core |
| book | 50 / none | Not identified; high iowait is the first lead |
| contention | 200 / 400 | PostgreSQL and app contention on the seat-status query |
| race | 200 / 300 | PostgreSQL and app contention on the seat-status query |

These are the highest configured steps that held under the baseline rules. They are not a measure of the service's maximum capacity. All 21 contention and race steps passed SQL verification: no Seat was booked twice, and the `201` and `409` counts add up. Under contention, the query that reads a Showtime's taken Seats (`booking` joined with `booked_seat`) used 51-149 s of database time per step, which makes it the first target for phase 2.

[`loadtest/`](loadtest/README.md) has the scenarios, seed data and reproduction steps.

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions ([`ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml)) runs on pull requests and on pushes to `main`. A change that touches only `docs/`, Markdown files or `LICENSE` skips it.

1. The `verify` job runs the load-test helper checks and `./mvnw verify`.
2. On a push to `main`, the `image` job builds the Docker image and pushes it to `ghcr.io/14m6d4/se-phase-01`, tagged `latest` and with the commit SHA.

## Known issues

Phase 1 deliberately stops short of these; phase 2 reruns the [load test](docs/loadtest-baseline.md) to measure each change.

| Issue | Severity | Impact | Phase 2 direction |
|---|---|---|---|
| Seat hoarding | High | Many free accounts can together keep a Showtime's Seats held without paying | Rate-limit holds, verify email before booking |
| Simulated payment | High | No gateway: payments can't fail and refunds move no money | Integrate a payment gateway; make charges and refunds idempotent |
| Tokens can't be revoked | High | A leaked token works for its full hour; no logout | Short-lived access tokens plus revocable refresh tokens |
| No rate limiting | High | Login can be brute-forced and endpoints flooded | Per-IP and per-account limits |
| One Admin | Medium | The Admin comes from env vars; no audit; rotating the password needs a restart | Admin management and an audit log |
| Seat contention settled by the database alone | Medium | Under contention the service holds 200-400 it/s, and most database time goes to reading which Seats are taken | Cheaper seat-status reads, then compare pessimistic locking, optimistic locking and a booking queue ([ADR 0004](docs/adr/0004-seat-contention-via-unique-constraint-and-lazy-holds.md)) |
| Seat layouts re-read every request | Medium | The most expensive browse query, though a layout never changes | Cache layouts per Auditorium |
| Single instance | Medium | No failover or horizontal scaling; CI publishes an image but nothing deploys it | Several instances behind a load balancer |
| Thin observability | Low | Health and metrics only | Tracing, structured logs, alerts |
| No pagination | Low | `GET /movies`, `/cinemas` and `/bookings` return every row | `page` and `size` parameters |
