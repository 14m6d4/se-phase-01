-- Load-test seed data (issue #18): 3 cinemas x 4 auditoriums (10 rows x 12 seats),
-- 20 movies, 7 future days of showtimes and 2,000 CUSTOMER accounts that all
-- share one prehashed bcrypt password.
--
-- Run AFTER the service has started (Flyway must have applied V1..V5) and only
-- against a fresh database: the inserts are not idempotent.
--
-- Shared credentials: loadtest-{1..2000}@loadtest.local / loadtest-password
-- (every account stores the same bcrypt hash; the raw password is never stored).
